# knapsack_DP

Given values and weights of n different items. One has to put these items in a knapsack of capacity C such that the knapsack has the maximum value. Also, the sum of weights of all the items present in the knapsack should not exceed the capacity C. Since it is a 0 - 1 knapsack problem; hence, splitting the item is not allowed, i.e., one can never break any given item, either do not pick it or pick it (0 - 1 property).
